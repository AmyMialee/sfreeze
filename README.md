# Sfreeze

Unsmelt items by sfreezing them with powder snow!

***

When an item is within a block of powder snow for long enough, it will sfreeze the stack of items into an uncooked form.

Additionally, powder snow has been made more easily obtainable. If a snow golem is damaged within a cauldron, it has a chance of shedding some snow into the cauldron, increasing the level of powder snow.

## What is sfreezing?

To sfreeze something is to unsmelt it; its name is derived by taking "smelt", and replacing the contained "melt" (to which "smelt" is etymologically related) with "freeze". Thence we get "sfreeze".

## How do I add my own sfreezing recipes?

Sfreezing is implemented by creating a new recipe type, so you can add your own sfreezing recipes the way you would a normal recipe, with the JSON format of

```json
{
  "type": "sfreeze:sfreezing",
  "ingredient": {
    "item": "namespace:item"
  },
  "result": {
    "id": "namespace:item"
  }
}
```

This is similar to how vanilla cooking recipes are defined.
